# CommitCrab: AI-Powered PR Performance Analytics Dashboard

## Executive Summary

CommitCrab is a comprehensive web application that revolutionizes pull request (PR) quality assessment and performance monitoring. By combining automated code analysis, web performance metrics, and AI-driven insights, CommitCrab empowers development teams to make data-driven decisions about code quality, performance impact, and deployment readiness.

## Problem Statement

Modern software development teams face significant challenges in maintaining code quality and performance standards:

### Current Pain Points
- **Lack of Visibility**: Teams struggle to understand the performance impact of code changes before deployment
- **Manual Code Reviews**: Reviewers often miss performance regressions, accessibility issues, and bundle size increases
- **Inconsistent Quality Metrics**: No standardized way to measure PR "health" across different projects and teams
- **Time-Consuming Analysis**: Developers spend excessive time analyzing performance metrics and identifying improvement opportunities
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Junior developers lack guidance on best practices for performance optimization

### Market Context
- Web performance directly impacts user experience and business metrics (conversion rates, bounce rates)
- Bundle size affects load times and mobile performance
- Code quality issues compound over time, leading to technical debt
- Manual processes don't scale with growing team sizes and project complexity

## Solution Overview

CommitCrab provides an integrated dashboard that automatically analyzes PRs and delivers actionable insights through:

- **Automated Performance Analysis**: Real-time web vitals tracking (LCP, TBT, CLS, FCP, SI, TTI)
- **Bundle Size Monitoring**: Detailed breakdown of JavaScript, CSS, images, and other assets
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Machine learning-generated suggestions for code improvements
- **Health Score Calculation**: Composite scoring system combining multiple quality metrics
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for trend analysis and comparative insights
